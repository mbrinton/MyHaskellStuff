Exercise 3.7 The fibonacci sequence is defined by:
Fn =  1 n = 1 or n = 2
Fn−2 + Fn−1 otherwise
Write a recursive function fib that takes a positive integer n as a 
parameter and calculates Fn.

Exercise 3.8 Define a recursive function mult that takes two positive 
integers a and b and returns a*b, but only uses addition (i.e., no fair 
just using multiplication). Begin by making a mathematical definition in the 
style of the previous exercise and the rest of this section.

Exercise 3.9 Define a recursive function my map that behaves identically to 
the standard function map.
